# PORTUNO API

The **PORTUNO API** is a Python API that implements CRUD _(Create, Read, Update, Delete)_ endpoints for the entities and tables of the `PostgreSQL` DATABASE: Classroom, Occupancy, Permission, User, Professor, SchoolClass, and Semester. The API is built using `Flask`, which is a lightweight and modular web framework.

The PORTUNO project was conceived as part of the Integrated Project I course and developed as part of the DATABASE I course in the Systems and Digital Media program at UFC (Federal University of Ceará).

# Getting started

Before starting to use the API, please follow the configuration steps below:

**Clone the repository to your local environment:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PORTUNO-SMD/portuno-api.git
   ```

**Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and set the required environment variables. These variables include the DATABASE credentials and other environment-specific configurations. A basic example of the `.env` file content is shown below:**

   ```
   USER
   PASSWORD
   HOST
   PORT
   DATABASE
   ```

**Install the project dependencies. In the project's root directory, run the following command:**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**After completing the above steps, you are ready to start the API.**

# Endpoints

The API follows an architecture with entity, DAO (Data Access Object), and controller layers. Each entity corresponds to a table in the DATABASE and has dedicated endpoints for CRUD operations. Below is the table with the available endpoints for each entity:
